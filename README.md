In this assignment, we learned how to use Node.js and create our own modules. We made a project with two JavaScript files: one to run the application and another with some helpful functions.

The four functions are:

Print Favorite Activities: We created a function that shows our favorite activities, like hiking, reading, and cooking. Distance Conversion: We made a function that changes measurements from one unit to another, like converting meters to kilometers and miles. Statistics Calculation: We built a function that finds the average, median, and mode from a set of numbers. Compound Interest Calculation: We created a function that calculates how much money you will have after earning interest on a principal amount over time.

main.js
This is the main entry point of the project. It imports functions from the utilities.js file and demonstrates their usage, such as printing favorite activities, converting distances, calculating statistics, and computing compound interest.

utilities.js
This file contains several functions: printFavoriteActivities(): Takes three activities as input and prints a welcome message. convertDistance(): Converts a given distance from one unit to another (e.g., meters to kilometers). calculateStatistics(): Computes the average, median, and mode of an array of numbers. calculateCompoundInterest(): Calculates the total amount and interest earned based on principal, rate, time, and times compounded.
